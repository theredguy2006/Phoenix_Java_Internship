What i wanna do is that user will login with his account id and password. 
then he will get options to either deposit cash , withdraw cash , 
see his transaction history and a option to print it out. 
then the final options to log out. 

What are some things i want to achieve. 
1.) The data of user must be stored in a text file. , 
so when the program start we have access to that data.
2.) Print out user/s passbook or update it in a passbook folder where the file name will be
accID_Name_Passbook format. It will contain all his transaction details. 

How i am gonna do it ??
1.) Main class will read the users file and initialize it and all. Also it will handle 
the creation of users too .
2.) Bank class will have the menu and all. It will handle the i guess banking logic and all
3.) All details in Current will be private and there will be setters and getters for all of them.
