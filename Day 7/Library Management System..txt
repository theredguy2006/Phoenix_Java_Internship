Library Management System.
What do i want to do ??
1.) User Logs in. Enter his/her username and then it verifies and also differentiate whether they are premium user or not. Premium User gets more extra books to borrow.
2.) User gets a menu that you can borrow a book. Donate a book. Check which books are available . Check which books they have borrowed and also display how many more they can. Logout option.

What do i need to follow and use.
1.)Interface
2.)Inheritance.
3.)Abstraction.

How am i Gonna do it ??
1.) Some Data will already be hard coded. Like 3 for Members and 2 for Premium Members.3 Books will be too.
Total Books-->10
Total Members-->5-->Memeber and 3 or 2---> Premium Members.
2.) Username will be unique so they can be used as ID simultaneously.
3.) Books will need ID. How am i gonna manage that. Create a book id counter in the main and use it. Since i only the need the id and just to initialize it and not much.
4.) How will i manage the books taken. I can store the id's in a array and do it guess ??
5.) Same to track which user has taken which books and all.
